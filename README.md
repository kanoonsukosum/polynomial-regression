# Polynomial Regression Analysis with World Bank Data

## Description
This Python project applies polynomial regression to explore the relationship between Japan's unemployment rates and GDP using data from The World Bank. It involves Python libraries such as NumPy for calculations, pandas for data handling, Matplotlib for visualization, and scikit-learn for polynomial regression analysis and R-squared evaluation. This effort illustrates the application of polynomial regression to examine non-linear dynamics in economic data, enhancing the understanding of economic indicators through practical data analysis and scientific computing techniques. 

## Dataset Source

## Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Clone this repository, then install the required libraries using pip: ``pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn``

## Usage
Run the script from your terminal or command prompt: ``python polynomial_regress.py``

The script will perform polynomial regression analysis on the dataset, outputting the regression coefficients, R-squared value, and generating plots to visualize the data and the regression line.
