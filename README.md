# Polynomial Regression Analysis with World Bank Data

## Description
This project is a Python-based analysis that extends beyond linear regression to apply the concept of polynomial regression to a real-world dataset provided by The World Bank. Leveraging essential Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for mathematical operations, Matplotlib for data visualization, and scikit-learn for implementing polynomial regression and computing the R-squared metric, this script showcases the application of polynomial regression techniques. Through this analysis, the project aims to uncover more complex, non-linear relationships within the data, offering deeper insights into global economic indicators. This initiative stands as a practical example of utilizing advanced data science methods to analyze and interpret intricate patterns in global datasets.

## Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Clone this repository, then install the required libraries using pip: pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scipy scikit-learn

## Usage
Run the script from your terminal or command prompt: python polynomial_regress.py

The script will perform polynomial regression analysis on the dataset, outputting the regression coefficients, R-squared value, and generating plots to visualize the data and the regression line.
